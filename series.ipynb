    "    In case, you are not able to spot an increasing or decreasing difference between the numbers, try to divide the 2nd term of the series with the first, the 2nd term with the 3rd term and so on. If the answer to the constant division comes as the same number, then this question belongs to the product series. \n",
    "\n",
    "    In case, none of the above approach works, you can write every term of the question as to the multiplication of 2 factors and try to    spot a pattern between the terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are not able to spot a pattern and the difference between the terms is decreasing or increasing at an accelerated rate, you can try for the square/cube series. \n",
